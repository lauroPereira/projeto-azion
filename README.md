## ✨ Project: EventStream – Real-Time Event Processing with Django, Kafka & ClickHouse

Welcome to EventStream – a hands-on, lightweight project built to showcase modern backend and data engineering skills using some of the most in-demand tools in today's cloud and distributed systems landscape.

This application simulates a real-world architecture where events are received via a REST API, pushed through a message broker, transformed in an ETL pipeline, and served via a GraphQL API for analytical queries – all containerized and ready for Kubernetes deployment.
Because... why just talk about your stack when you can build with it?

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python + Django (REST API, JWT Auth)

* GraphQL (Graphene)

* PostgreSQL (Transactional storage)

* ClickHouse (Analytical DB)

* Kafka / RabbitMQ (Message Broker)

* Apache Airflow (ETL Pipeline)

* Docker + Kubernetes (Deployment-ready)

* Pytest (Testing)

* GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
> “Tell me about a time you had to integrate multiple services with scalability and performance in mind.” 

**Here's one way to do it.**

This project was created as a practical exploration of how modern systems can be integrated and deployed efficiently, using technologies widely adopted in cloud-native and event-driven architectures.

## 🚀 Try It Out (soon...)
Deployment to a serverless edge or cloud-native platform coming soon. Stay tuned 😉
